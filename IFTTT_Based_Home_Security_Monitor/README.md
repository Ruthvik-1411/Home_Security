# Home Intrusion Alert System
The aim of this project is to design an intruder alert system that notifies the user in case of a break in via mail. The concept can be applied to a get a phone call or a message as most of the people respond to them quickly. If the alarm is armed and if the door is opened then a buzzer starts making noise and the user gets a mail saying that there is a break in and the alarm is triggered.<br><br>

<p>The implementation is a bit longer as it includes the latency in data entry which results in no action sometimes. So those parts were not edited to show that latency.<br>
